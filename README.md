## Table of Contents

Chapter 1. Introduction to Computational Psychometrics: towards a principled integration of data science and machine learning techniques into psychometrics
> **Authors**: Alina A. von Davier, Robert J. Mislevy and Jiangang Hao

> **Abstract:** In this chapter we articulate what is computational psychometrics, why
we need a volume focused on it, and how this book contributes to the expansion of
psychometric toolbox to include methodologies from machine learning and data
science in order to address the complexities of big data collected from virtual
learning and assessment systems. We also discuss here the structure of the edited
volume, how each chapter contributes to enhancing the psychometrics science and
our recommendations for further readings.

### Part I Conceptualization

Chapter 2. Next generation learning and assessment: what, why and how
> **Author**: Robert Mislevy

> **Abstract:** Computational psychometrics is a blend of stochastic processes theory,
computer science-based methods, and theory-based psychometric approaches that
may aid the analyses of complex data from performance assessments. This chapter
discusses the grounds for using complex performance assessments, the design of
such assessments so that useful evidence about targeted abilities will be present
in the data to be analysed, and roles that computational psychometric ideas and
methods can play. It first provides background on a situative, sociocognitive,
perspective on human capabilities and how we develop them and use them—a
perspective we believe is necessary to synthesize the methodologies. Next it reviews
the form of evidentiary argument that underlies the evidence-centered approach
to design, interpretation, and use of educational assessments. It then points out
junctures in extensions of the argument form where computational psychometric
methods can carry out vital roles in assessment of more advanced constructs, from
more complex data, in new forms and contexts of assessment. It concludes by
reflecting on how one reconceives and extends the notions of validity, reliability,
comparability, fairness, and generalizability to more complex assessments and
analytic methods.

Chapter 3. Computational psychometrics 
> **Authors** Alina A. von Davier, Kristen DiCerbo and Josine Verhagen

> **Abstract:** In recent years the advances in technology provided affordances for
learning and assessments opportunities. In this chapter we first describe computational
psychometrics as a framework for the measurement of learners’ skills,
knowledge, and abilities. We discuss the changes in educational measurement
that led to the need for expanding the psychometrics toolbox and describe the
properties of psychometric data. We then give an example of a class of models,
the Dynamic Bayesian Models that encompass many traditional psychometric
models and machine-learning algorithms. We conclude by emphasizing that model
complexity and power need to be balanced with the responsibility for transparency
and fairness towards stakeholders.
