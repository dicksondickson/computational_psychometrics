## Table of Contents

Chapter 1. Introduction to Computational Psychometrics: towards a principled integration of data science and machine learning techniques into psychometrics
> Authors: Alina A. von Davier, Robert J. Mislevy and Jiangang Hao

> **Abstract:** In this chapter we articulate what is computational psychometrics, why
we need a volume focused on it, and how this book contributes to the expansion of
psychometric toolbox to include methodologies from machine learning and data
science in order to address the complexities of big data collected from virtual
learning and assessment systems. We also discuss here the structure of the edited
volume, how each chapter contributes to enhancing the psychometrics science and
our recommendations for further readings.
